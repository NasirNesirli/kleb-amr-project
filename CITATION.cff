title: "Interpretable Deep-Learning and Ensemble Models for Predicting Multidrug Resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae"
version: 1.0.0
date-released: 2024-11-27
url: "https://github.com/username/klebsiella_amr_prediction"
repository-code: "https://github.com/username/klebsiella_amr_prediction"
abstract: "A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Klebsiella pneumoniae using interpretable deep-learning and ensemble models. The pipeline integrates genomic features (AMR genes, SNPs, k-mer spectra) with advanced ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM, 1D-CNN, DNABERT) to achieve high-performance AMR prediction with cross-model interpretability analysis."
